        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    As one of Codeshares' core values is to become a zero carbon footprint company we want to help our clients do the same. 
    To do so we code green by planting one tree in Africa for each coding hour purchased. By choosing Codeshares as your software 
    development partner you plant trees and help create carbon sinks. Tree planting also provides work and life opportunities for local African people. PITÄISIKÖ TÄSSÄ MAINITA, ETTÄ TYÖLLISTÄMME 2 HENKILÖÄ YHDESSÄ SISARYRITYKSEMME SHADESHARESIN KANSSA XXX KYLÄSSÄ TMV.?
    We work in cooperation with Kenya Forest and local operators who plant and nurture the seedlings. Codeshares plants the following species of trees: 
    avocado, grevillea robusta (southern silky oak), casuarina, croton ja crafted mangoes.

      My role in Codeshares is to coordinate tree planting project. When I joined college to pursue a Master’s Degree in Global Health, environment conservation became one of my biggest interests. As I was looking for an organization that would do its part to fight for our planet, I am so grateful to have come upon Codeshares, to share my passion, determination and grow with. Being part of this team drives me towards achieving my childhood dream of becoming environmentalist to protect our natural heritage. I am so excited to contribute in anyway I can to this important cause.

  heading: The Coding School Initiative
  description: >-
    We at Codeshares care about the community we operate in and want to contribute to it. Thus we are currently in the process of opening a coding school for youths 
    living in the slums of Nairobi in cooperation with World Vision. The school will be run at the SOS Technical Village in BuruBuru, Nairobi. Our students will be mentored and 
    taught by Codeshares’ own coders. The vetting and screening process of the students will be done in cooperation with World Vision Kenya. 

    In addition to helping our clients reduce their carbon footprint by planting a tree for each coding hour purchased, 
    we want to offer our clients the opportunity to sponsor the Coding School as a charity project.

    Currently we are working on developing the curriculum and hope to open our school next spring AFTER COVID-19 TIMES ARE BEHIND US. 
    So far it has been a great learning experience and we couldn’t be more excited to get things up and running!
