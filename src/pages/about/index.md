### What is Codeshares
The lack of software developers in Finland and in several other countries is an everyday challenge many companies struggle with. We wanted to find a different type of solution for this. A sustainable solution by which we could help our clients develop their businesses and, at the same time, do good for the future of our Globe.

That is why Codeshares was born.

Codeshares is a software development company that has sustainability in the core of its dna. Both, social and environmental responsibility, are essential building materials of the company. 

### Origin
Our software developers’ team is based in Nairobi, Kenya. The field of IT in Kenya is developing rapidly, and the level of education for the needs of the field of industry is very high. By employing the highly educated professionals in their own home country, we strive to make an impact on sustainable development of the community as well as reduce mass migration and brain drain from Kenya to other continents. Together with our employees we also want to give back to those in the community who have been less fortunate in life. Our upcoming Coding School project, which we do in cooperation with World Vision, is all about charity and helping the youths of the slums to find new paths for life.

### Sustainable
Caring about the environment and reducing own carbon footprint are topics most companies have as essential parts in their strategy nowadays. However, it’s not always easy to find ways how to make them happen. At Codeshares we have made it possible for our clients to bring that part of strategy to life! For every coding hour purchased from Codeshares, we plant one tree in Kenya. The bigger the project, the bigger the impact for the future of our Globe!

### Direct
In addition, we have put a lot of effort on making cooperation with Codeshares easy and affordable to each and every client. Thus Kenya is in the same time zone, working with the team is very convenient. All our projects are led by Finnish Project Manager or Project Architect. We use agile ways of working, and our clients are free to choose the level of participation in the projects – some like to take part in weeklys or even dailys, some feel more comfortable taking part in bi-weekly project meetings between sprints. Software development projects implemented with Codeshares also are suitable for different sizes of businesses and budgets thus we offer our clients cost efficient solutions.


Welcome to join the journey to a more sustanaibly developed future with us!
