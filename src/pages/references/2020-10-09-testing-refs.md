##### Client’s need

Previously Finnprofiles’ sales team used separate excel templates in its sales calculations. This posed a lot of challenges in the day-to-day work, and by using separate excels storing data and updating it was neither up-to-date nor transparent. In addition, the variable data that significantly affects offer calculations were not updated in the calculations.



The main goal of the new system was to replace all excels and bring the data storage and maintenance all into one place. Thus, the new system would act as an important pricing program to support sales while sales representatives are on the field. The clients’ wish was that the system is easy to use, visual, works as a guiding tool for sales representatives and is easy to use on all different devices.

##### Codeshares’ solution

The new system was implemented as a modern web application running on top of the cloud service. This ensures immediate access to the service, regardless of the device or location used and ensures data consistency. The system’s user management also enables better service for different user groups.



##### Client’s comments

**“** *As the needs for the application became more specific in our company, we started looking for a software development partner. In our discussions with Codeshares it became clear that they approach the issue in a very practical and client oriented way. The choice was easy because our goals were well understood and it was clear to all what was going to be done.*

*During the course of the project, progress was regularly monitored in short and concise remote meetings and it was made sure that the team stayed on target. Codeshares was very committed to the goals and schedules of the project. From the client’s point of view I am very pleased with the project approach and the fact that costs remained within budget and deadlines were met. A great addition is also the perspective on green and humane thinking where concrete actions demonstrate caring for our common environment by planting trees and increasing the well-being of an evolving society.**”***
